## Description

The HTTP **`429 Too Many Requests`** [client error response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#client_error_responses) status code indicates the client has sent too many requests in a given amount of time. This mechanism of asking the client to slow down the rate of requests is commonly called "[rate limiting](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Rate_limit)".

A [`Retry-After`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Retry-After) header may be included to this response to indicate how long a client should wait before making the request again.

Implementations of rate limiting vary; restrictions may be server-wide or per resource. Typically, rate-limiting restrictions are based on a client's IP but can be specific to users or authorized applications if requests are authenticated or contain a [cookie](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cookie).

### Examples

The following request is being sent repeatedly in a loop by a client that is misconfigured:

http

    GET /reports/mdn HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    

In this example, server-wide rate limiting is active when a client exceeds a set threshold of requests per minute. A 429 response is returned with a [`Retry-After`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Retry-After) header that indicates that requests will be allowed for this client again in 60 minutes:

http

    HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
    Content-Type: text/html
    Retry-After: 3600
    
    <html lang="en-US">
      <head>
        <title>Too Many Requests</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Too Many Requests</h1>
        <p>You're doing that too often! Try again later.</p>
      </body>
    </html>
