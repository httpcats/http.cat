## Description

The HTTP **`301 Moved Permanently`** [redirection response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#redirection_messages) status code indicates that the requested resource has been permanently moved to the URL in the [`Location`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Location) header.

A browser receiving this status will automatically request the resource at the URL in the `Location` header, redirecting the user to the new page. Search engines receiving this response will attribute links to the original URL to the redirected resource, passing the [SEO](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SEO) ranking to the new URL.

**Note:** In the [Fetch Standard](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-redirect-fetch), when a user agent receives a `301` in response to a [`POST`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/POST) request, it uses the [`GET`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/GET) method in the subsequent redirection request, as permitted by the HTTP [specification](#specifications). To avoid user agents modifying the request, use [`308 Permanent Redirect`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/308) instead, as altering the method after a `308` response is prohibited.

### Examples

The following [`GET`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/GET) request is made to a resource with a `301` redirection in place.

http

    GET /en-US/docs/AJAX HTTP/2
    Host: developer.mozilla.org
    User-Agent: curl/8.6.0
    Accept: */*
    

The response includes the `301` status along with the [`Location`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Location) header that indicates the URL where the resource has moved.

http

    HTTP/2 301

    location: /en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Scripting/Network_requests
