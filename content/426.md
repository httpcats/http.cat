## Description

The HTTP **`426 Upgrade Required`** [client error response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#client_error_responses) status code indicates that the server refused to perform the request using the current protocol but might be willing to do so after the client upgrades to a different protocol.

The server sends an [`Upgrade`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Upgrade) header with this response to indicate the required protocol(s).

### Examples

Given a GET request to a system:

http

    GET /resources HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    

The origin server expects that requests must be made in [HTTP/3](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP_3):

http

    HTTP/1.1 426 Upgrade Required
    Upgrade: HTTP/3.0
    Connection: Upgrade
    Content-Length: 53
    Content-Type: text/plain
    
    This service requires use of the HTTP/3.0 protocol.
