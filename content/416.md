## Description

The HTTP **`416 Range Not Satisfiable`** [client error response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#client_error_responses) status code indicates that a server could not serve the requested ranges. The most likely reason for this response is that the document doesn't contain such [ranges](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Range_requests), or that the [`Range`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Range) header value, though syntactically correct, doesn't make sense.

The `416` response message should contain a [`Content-Range`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Range) indicating an unsatisfied range (that is a `'*'`) followed by a `'/'` and the current length of the resource, e.g., `Content-Range: bytes */12777`

When encountering this error, browsers typically either abort the operation (for example, a download will be considered non-resumable) or request the whole document again without ranges.

### Examples

The following request asks for a range of 1000-1999 bytes from a text file. The first position unit (1000) is larger than the actual resource on the server (800 bytes):

http

    GET /files/prose.txt HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Range: bytes=1000-1999
    

The server supports range requests and sends back the current length of the selected representation in the [`Content-Range`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Range) header:

http

    HTTP/1.1 416 Range Not Satisfiable
    Date: Fri, 28 Jun 2024 11:40:58 GMT
    Content-Range: bytes */800
