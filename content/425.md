## Description

Limited availability

This feature is not Baseline because it does not work in some of the most widely-used browsers.

if (localStorage.getItem("baseline-indicator") === "open") { const indicator = document.querySelector(".baseline-indicator"); if (indicator instanceof HTMLDetailsElement) { indicator.open = true; } }

The HTTP **`425 Too Early`** [client error response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#client_error_responses) status code indicates that the server was unwilling to risk processing a request that might be replayed to avoid potential replay attacks.

If a client has interacted with a server recently, early data (also known as zero round-trip time [(0-RTT) data](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Defenses/Transport_Layer_Security#tls_1.3)) allows the client to send data to a server in the first round trip of a connection, without waiting for the TLS [handshake](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/TCP_handshake) to complete. A client that sends a request in early data does not need to include the `Early-Data` header. See [`Early-Data`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Early-Data) for more information.
