## Description

The HTTP **`411 Length Required`** [client error response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#client_error_responses) status code indicates that the server refused to accept the request without a defined [`Content-Length`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Length) header.

**Note:** When sending data in a series of chunks, the `Content-Length` header is omitted, and at the beginning of each chunk, the length of the current chunk needs to be included in hexadecimal format. See [`Transfer-Encoding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Transfer-Encoding) for more details.

### Examples

The following request is sent chunked, which is the default method of sending data in some cases, such as when [writing to streams](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#requestwritechunk-encoding-callback):

http

    POST /translate/de HTTP/1.1
    Host: api.example.com
    Content-Type: application/json
    Transfer-encoding: chunked
    
    2C
    {"text": "Hurry up, Ayşe is hungry!"}
    0
    

In this case, the server is expecting a request in one part with a [`Content-Length`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Length) header and returns a 411 response:

http

    HTTP/1.1 411 Length Required
    Content-Type: application/json
    Content-Length: 110
    
    {
      "message": "Requests must have a content length header.",
      "documentation": "http://api/example.com/docs/errors",
    }
