## Description

<aside class="warning"><strong>Unofficial:</strong> This HTTP status code is not specified by any RFC.</aside>

The HTTP status code `218 This Is Fine` is an unofficial code that indicates the server has encountered a minor issue but continues to operate without disruption, signaling that "everything is fine" despite a manageable error.

This code serves to communicate success while acknowledging a minor HTTP client or server issue, without impacting overall functionality.

### Apache and Proxy-Error-Override

In some cases, this status code may appear if a server is configured with custom error handling. By using `ProxyErrorOverride`, servers can override standard 4xx or 5xx responses with `218` for minor issues, helping maintain a consistent user experience.
