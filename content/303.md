## Description

The HTTP **`303 See Other`** [redirection response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#redirection_messages) status code indicates that the browser should redirect to the URL in the [`Location`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Location) header instead of rendering the requested resource.

This response code is often sent back as a result of [`PUT`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/PUT) or [`POST`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/POST) methods so the client may retrieve a confirmation, or view a representation of a real-world object (see [HTTP range-14](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTPRange-14)). The method to retrieve the redirected resource is always [`GET`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/GET).

### Examples

The client in this example sends a [`POST`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/POST) request to submit a form to a generic subscription.

http

    POST /subscribe HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    Content-Length: 50
    
    name=Brian%20Smith&email=brian.smith%40example.com
    

The server may send back a response with a `303` status and a confirmation page in the [`Location`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Location) header, so the user is redirected there after receiving the response.

http

    HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
    Location: https://www.example.com/confirmation/event/123
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
    Content-Length: 0
