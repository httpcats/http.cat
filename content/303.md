redirect status response code indicates that the redirects don't link to the requested resource itself, but to another page (such as a confirmation page, a representation of a real-world object — see HTTP range-14 — or an upload-progress page). This response code is often sent back as a result of
PUT or POST. The method used to display this
redirected page is always GET.
