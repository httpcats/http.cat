## Description

The HTTP **`451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons`** [client error response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#client_error_responses) status code indicates that the user requested a resource that is not available due to legal reasons, such as a web page for which a legal action has been issued.

### Examples

This example response is taken from the IETF RFC (see below) and contains a reference to [Monty Python's Life of Brian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python's_Life_of_Brian).

**Note:** The [`Link`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Link) header might also contain a `rel="blocked-by"` relation identifying the entity implementing the blockage, not any other entity mandating it.

Any attempt to identify the entity ultimately responsible for the resource being unavailable belongs in the response body, not in the `rel="blocked-by"` link. This includes the name of the person or organization that made a legal demand resulting in the content's removal.
