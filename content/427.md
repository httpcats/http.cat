## Description
The `427 Invalid Digital Signature` status code indicates that the request has failed due to an invalid digital signature. 

This is not a standard status code !

This status is useful in systems where digital signature validation is essential to ensure data authenticity and integrity.

### Explanation
When an HTTP request is made, certain applications may require a digital signature to verify the sender's identity and the data's integrity. If this signature is incorrect, expired, or altered, the server may return a 427 error to indicate it could not validate the origin or integrity of the request.
