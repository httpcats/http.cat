## Description

<aside class="warning"><strong>Unofficial:</strong> This HTTP status code is not specified by any RFC.</aside>

The `427 Invalid Digital Signature` status code indicates that the request has failed due to an invalid digital signature. 

This status is useful in systems where digital signature validation is essential to ensure data authenticity and integrity.

When an HTTP request is made, certain applications may require a digital signature to verify the sender's identity and the data's integrity. If this signature is incorrect, expired, or altered, the server may return a 427 error to indicate it could not validate the origin or integrity of the request.
