## Description

The HTTP **`101 Switching Protocols`** [informational response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#informational_responses) status code indicates the protocol that a server has switched to. The protocol is specified in the [`Upgrade`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Upgrade) request header received from a client.

The server includes an [`Upgrade`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Upgrade) header in this response to indicate the protocol it has agreed to switch to. The process is described in detail in the [Protocol upgrade mechanism](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Protocol_upgrade_mechanism) guide.

### Examples

The following example shows how switching protocols might be used with [WebSockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API). A client sends a [`GET`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/GET) HTTP request with an [`Upgrade`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Upgrade) header which must also be listed in the [`Connection`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Connection) header. The server agrees to switch protocols, returning a 101 response meaning the connection has switched from HTTP to WebSocket. At this point, the client and server can now start exchanging WebSocket data. Information about how to set `Sec-WebSocket-*` headers for handshake negotiation can be found in [WebSocket-specific headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Protocol_upgrade_mechanism#websocket-specific_headers).

    Upgrade: websocket
    Connection: Upgrade
