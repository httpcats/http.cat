## Description

The HTTP `101 Switching Protocols` response code indicates
a protocol to which the server switches.
The protocol is specified in the [Upgrade](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Upgrade) request header received from a client.

The server includes in this response an [Upgrade](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Upgrade) response header to
indicate the protocol it switched to.

The process is described in the following article:
[Protocol upgrade mechanism](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Protocol_upgrade_mechanism)
