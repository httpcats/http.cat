## Description

The HTTP **`406 Not Acceptable`** [client error response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#client_error_responses) status code indicates that the server could not produce a response matching the list of acceptable values defined in the request's [proactive content negotiation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Content_negotiation#server-driven_content_negotiation) headers and that the server was unwilling to supply a default representation.

Proactive content negotiation headers include:

* [`Accept`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Accept)
* [`Accept-Encoding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Accept-Encoding)
* [`Accept-Language`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Accept-Language)

A server may return responses that differ from the request's accept headers. In such cases, a [`200`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/200) response with a default resource that doesn't match the client's list of acceptable content negotiation values may be preferable to sending a 406 response.

If a server returns a 406, the body of the message should contain the list of available representations for the resource, allowing the user to choose, although no standard way for this is defined.

### Examples

The following request assumes that `www.example.com/docs/doc1` supports sending a document back as `application/rtf`:

http

    GET /docs/doc1 HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Accept: application/rtf;
    

In this example, the server implementation does not fallback to a default content type like `text/html` or `application/json`, but returns a 406 instead:

http

    HTTP/1.1 406 Not Acceptable
    Date: Wed, 26 Jun 2024 12:00:00 GMT
    Server: Apache/2.4.1 (Unix)
    Content-Type: application/json
    
    {
      "code": "UnsupportedType",
      "message": "Only 'text/html' or 'application/json' content types supported.",
    }
