## Description

<aside class="alert"><strong>Deprecated:</strong> The HTTP 305 Use Proxy status code has been deprecated due to security concerns and many HTTP clients ignore this status code.</aside>

HTTP response status code `305 Use Proxy` is a deprecated HTTP status code returned by an origin server to indicate that the requested resource can only be accessed through a proxy server.

The `305 Use Proxy` status code is used to inform the client that the requested resource must be obtained through a proxy server and includes that proxy address in the `Set-Proxy` HTTP header or in the `Location` HTTP header.
