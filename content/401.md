## Description

The HTTP **`401 Unauthorized`** [client error response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#client_error_responses) status code indicates that a request was not successful because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the requested resource. This status code is sent with an HTTP [`WWW-Authenticate`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/WWW-Authenticate) response header that contains information on the [authentication scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Authentication#authentication_schemes) the server expects the client to include to make the request successfully.

A `401 Unauthorized` is similar to the [`403 Forbidden`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/403) response, except that a 403 is returned when a request contains valid credentials, but the client does not have permissions to perform a certain action.

### Examples

The following GET request is made to a URL `www.example.com/admin` that expects credentials in an [`Authorization`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Authorization) header:

http

    GET /admin HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    

The server responds with a 401 message and a [`WWW-Authenticate`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/WWW-Authenticate) header indicating that the request must be authenticated and that `Bearer` auth (an access token) is the permitted [authentication scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Authentication#authentication_schemes):

http

    HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
    Date: Tue, 02 Jul 2024 12:18:47 GMT
    WWW-Authenticate: Bearer
