## Description

The HTTP **`204 No Content`** [successful response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#successful_responses) status code indicates that a request has succeeded, but the client doesn't need to navigate away from its current page. A `204` response is cacheable by default, and an [`ETag`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/ETag) header is included in such cases.

A `204 No Content` in response to these request methods has the following meaning and results:

* [`DELETE`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/DELETE): The action was successful, and no further information needs to be supplied.
* [`PUT`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/PUT): The action was successful, and the [`ETag`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/ETag) value contains the entity tag for the new representation of that target resource.

A `204` response can be used when implementing "save and continue editing" functionality for applications like wiki sites. In this case, a [`PUT`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/PUT) request could be used to save the page contents, and a `204 No Content` response indicates to the browser that the editor should not be replaced by other content.

Note that the response must not include any content or the [`Content-Length`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Length) header (browsers may reject responses that include content).

### Examples

In this example, the client sends a request to delete an image using the `DELETE` method. The request includes an [`Authorization`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Authorization) header with a token to authenticate the request:

http

    DELETE /image/123 HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Authorization: Bearer 1234abcd
    

After successfully deleting the image, the server responds with a `204` response with no body, indicating no further information needs to be sent to the client.

http

    HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
    Date: Wed, 26 Jun 2024 12:00:00 GMT
    Server: Apache/2.4.1 (Unix)
    

In this example, the client sends a `PUT` request to update a user's profile information. The request includes an [`Authorization`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Authorization) header with a token to authenticate the request:

http

    PUT /users/123 HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Content-Type: application/json
    Authorization: Bearer 1234abcd
    
    {
      "name": "Jane Doe",
      "email": "jane@example.com"
    }
    

After successfully updating the user profile, the server responds with a `204` response. The [`ETag`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/ETag) header contains the entity tag for the updated resource:

http

    HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
    Date: Wed, 26 Jun 2024 12:00:00 GMT
    ETag: "33a64df551425fcc55e4d42a148795d9f25f89d4"
    Server: Apache/2.4.1 (Unix)
