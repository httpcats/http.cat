## Description

The HTTP **`413 Content Too Large`** [client error response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#client_error_responses) status code indicates that the request entity was larger than limits defined by server. The server might close the connection or return a [`Retry-After`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Retry-After) header field.

Prior to [RFC 9110](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9110) the response phrase for the status was **`Payload Too Large`**. This message is still widely used.

### Examples

The following example shows what the client may send when an [`<input type="file">`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/file) element includes an image on form submission with `method="post"`:

http

    POST /upload HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Content-Type: multipart/form-data; boundary=----Boundary1234
    Content-Length: 4012345
    
    ------Boundary1234
    Content-Disposition: form-data; name="file"; filename="myImage.jpg"
    Content-Type: image/jpeg
    
    \xFF\xD8\xFF\xE0\x00...(binary data)
    ------Boundary1234--
    

The server may reject the upload if there is a restriction on the maximum size of files it will process, and the response body includes a `message` with some context:

http

    HTTP/1.1 413 Content Too Large
    Content-Type: application/json
    Content-Length: 97
    
    {
      "error": "Upload failed",
      "message": "Maximum allowed upload size is 4MB",
    }
