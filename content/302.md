## Description

The HTTP **`302 Found`** [redirection response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#redirection_messages) status code indicates that the requested resource has been temporarily moved to the URL in the [`Location`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Location) header.

A browser receiving this status will automatically request the resource at the URL in the `Location` header, redirecting the user to the new page. Search engines receiving this response will not attribute links to the original URL to the new resource, meaning no [SEO](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SEO) value is transferred to the new URL.

**Note:** In the [Fetch Standard](https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-redirect-fetch), when a user agent receives a `302` in response to a [`POST`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/POST) request, it uses the [`GET`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/GET) method in the subsequent redirection request, as permitted by the HTTP [specification](#specifications). To avoid user agents modifying the request, use [`307 Temporary Redirect`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/307) instead, as altering the method after a `307` response is prohibited.

In cases where you want any request method to be changed to [`GET`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/GET), use [`303 See Other`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/303). This is useful when you want to give a response to a [`PUT`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/PUT) method that is not the uploaded resource but a confirmation message such as: "you successfully uploaded XYZ".
