## Description

The HTTP **`300 Multiple Choices`** [redirection response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#redirection_messages) status code indicates that the request has more than one possible response. The user-agent or the user should choose one of them.

**Note:** In [agent-driven content negotiation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Content_negotiation#agent-driven_negotiation), a client and server collaboratively decide the best variant of a given resource when the server has multiple variants. Most clients lack a method for automatically choosing from responses, and the additional round-trips slow down client-server interaction. [Server-driven content negotiation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Content_negotiation#server-driven_content_negotiation) is far more common, where a server chooses the most appropriate resource for the client based on the request headers ([`Accept-Language`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Accept-Language), [`Accept`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Accept), etc.).

The server should include content in the response that contains a list of resource metadata and URIs from which the user or user agent can choose. The format of the content is implementation-specific, but should be easily parsed by the user agent (such as HTML or JSON).

If the server has a preferred choice that the client should request, it can include it in a [`Location`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Location) header.

### Examples

The following example demonstrates a Transparent Content Negotiation request-response exchange. An Apache server offers multiple variants of a resource defined in a [type map](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/trunk/mod/mod_negotiation.html#typemaps); `index.html.en` for a resource in English, and `index.html.fr` for a French version:

http

    URI: index.html.en
    Content-Language: en
    
    URI: index.html.fr
    Content-Language: fr
    

A `Negotiate: trans` request header indicates that the client wants to use TCN to choose a resource. Poor browser support for this mechanism means a user agent such as curl must be used instead:

bash

     curl -v -H "Negotiate: trans" http://localhost/index
    

This produces the following request:

http

    GET /index HTTP/1.1
    Host: localhost
    User-Agent: curl/8.7.1
    Accept: */*
    Negotiate: trans
    

We receive a `300` response with details of different representations of the requested resource:
