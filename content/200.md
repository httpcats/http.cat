## Description

The HTTP **`200 OK`** [successful response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#successful_responses) status code indicates that a request has succeeded. A `200 OK` response is cacheable by default.

A `200 OK` response has a different meaning and format depending on the HTTP request method. Here's how they vary for different methods:

* [`GET`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/GET): A resource was retrieved by the server and included in the response body.
* [`POST`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/POST): An action succeeded; the response has a message body describing the result.
* [`HEAD`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/HEAD): Identical to `GET`, except there is no message body.
* [`TRACE`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/TRACE): The response has a message body containing the request as received by the server.

Although possible, successful [`PUT`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/PUT) or [`DELETE`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/DELETE) requests often do not result in a `200 OK` response. It is more common to see [`201 Created`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/201) if the resource is uploaded or created for the first time, or [`204 No Content`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/204) upon successful deletion of a resource.

### Examples

In this example, a successful `GET` request to `https://example.com` returns a `200 OK` response. The response includes representation headers and a message body with the HTML content:

http

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Accept-Ranges: bytes
    Age: 294510
    Cache-Control: max-age=604800
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
    Date: Fri, 21 Jun 2024 14:18:33 GMT
    Etag: "3147526947"
    Expires: Fri, 28 Jun 2024 14:18:33 GMT
    Last-Modified: Thu, 17 Oct 2019 07:18:26 GMT
    Server: ECAcc (nyd/D10E)
    X-Cache: HIT
    Content-Length: 1256
    
    <!doctype html>
    <!-- HTML content follows here -->
    

Assuming a form exists to send data to an endpoint for managing subscriptions at `http://example.com/subscribe`. A `POST` request to subscribe a user may look like the following:

http

    POST /subscribe HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    Content-Length: 50
    
    name=Brian%20Smith&email=brian.smith%40example.com
    

In this example, a response with a `200 OK` status could look like this:

http

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/json
    
    {
      "message": "User subscription pending. A confirmation email has been sent.",
      "subscription": {
        "name": "Brian Smith",
        "email": "brian.smith@example.com",
        "id": 123,
        "feed": "default"
      }
    }
