The HTTP 200 OK success status response code indicates that the request has succeeded. A 200 response is cacheable by default.
The meaning of a success depends on the HTTP request method:

  GET: The resource has been fetched and is transmitted in the message body.
  HEAD: The representation headers are included in the response without any message body
  POST: The resource describing the result of the action is transmitted in the message body
  TRACE: The message body contains the request message as received by the server.

The successful result of a PUT or a DELETE is often not a 200 OK but a 204 No Content (or a 201 Created when the resource is uploaded for the first time).
