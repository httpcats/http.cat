## Description

The HTTP **`403 Forbidden`** [client error response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#client_error_responses) status code indicates that the server understood the request but refused to process it. This status is similar to [`401`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/401), except that for **`403 Forbidden`** responses, authenticating or re-authenticating makes no difference. The request failure is tied to application logic, such as insufficient permissions to a resource or action.

Clients that receive a `403` response should expect that repeating the request without modification will fail with the same error. Server owners may decide to send a [`404`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/404) response instead of a 403 if acknowledging the existence of a resource to clients with insufficient privileges is not desired.

### Examples

The following example request is made to an API for user management. The request contains an [`Authorization`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Authorization) header using `Bearer` [authentication scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Authentication#authentication_schemes) containing an access token:

http

    DELETE /users/123 HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Authorization: Bearer abcd123
    

The server has authenticated the request, but the action fails due to insufficient rights and the response body contains a reason for the failure:

http

    HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
    Date: Tue, 02 Jul 2024 12:56:49 GMT
    Content-Type: application/json
    Content-Length: 88
    
    {
      "error": "InsufficientPermissions",
      "message": "Deleting users requires the 'admin' role."
    }
