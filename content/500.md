## Description

The HTTP `500 Internal Server Error` server error response code indicates that the server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.

This error response is a generic "catch-all" response. Usually, this indicates the server cannot find a better `5xx` error code to response. Sometimes, server administrators log error responses like the `500` status code with more details about the request to prevent the error from happening again in the future.
