## Description

The HTTP **`206 Partial Content`** [successful response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#successful_responses) status code is sent in response to a [range request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Range_requests). The response body contains the requested ranges of data as specified in the [`Range`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Range) header of the request.

The format of the response depends on the number of ranges requested. If a single range is requested, the [`Content-Type`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Type) of the entire response is set to the type of the document, and a [`Content-Range`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Range) is provided. If several ranges are requested, the [`Content-Type`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Type) is set to `multipart/byteranges`, and each fragment covers one range, with its own [`Content-Range`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Range) and [`Content-Type`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Type) headers describing it.

### Examples

The following is a sample `206` response when a single range of `21010-` (bytes 21010 to the end of file) of an image file is requested. The response contains [`Content-Type`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Type) of `image/gif` and the [`Content-Range`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Range) is provided:

http

    GET /z4d4kWk.gif HTTP/1.1
    Host: images.example.com
    Range: bytes=21010-
