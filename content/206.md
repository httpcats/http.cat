The HTTP 206 Partial Content success status response code
indicates that the request has succeeded and the body contains the requested ranges
of data, as described in the Range header of the request.

If there is only one range, the Content-Type of the whole response is
set to the type of the document, and a Content-Range is provided.

If several ranges are sent back, the Content-Type is set to
multipart/byteranges and each fragment covers one range, with
Content-Range and Content-Type describing it.
