## Description

The HTTP **`510 Not Extended`** [server error response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#server_error_responses) status code is sent when the client request declares an HTTP Extension ([RFC 2774](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2774)) that should be used to process the request, but the extension is not supported.

### Examples

In the following example, a client sends a request with a mandatory extension specified in the `C-MAN` header. The [`Connection`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Connection) header specifies that these extensions are to be handled on a [hop-by-hop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers#hop-by-hop_headers) basis. A [proxy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Proxy_server) forwards the extended request, but the [`Connection`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Connection) header is stripped out in transit. Because the origin server doesn't receive any information about the `M-GET` method, it sends a `510` in response:

http

    M-GET /document HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    C-Man: "http://www.example.org/"
    Connection: C-Man
    

http

    HTTP/1.1 510 Not Extended
