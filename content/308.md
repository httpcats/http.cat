## Description

The HTTP **`308 Permanent Redirect`** [redirection response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#redirection_messages) status code indicates that the requested resource has been permanently moved to the URL given by the [`Location`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Location) header.

A browser receiving this status will automatically request the resource at the URL in the `Location` header, redirecting the user to the new page.

The request method and the body **will not be modified** by the client in the redirected request. A [`301 Moved Permanently`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/301) requires the request method and the body to remain unchanged when redirection is performed, but this is incorrectly handled by older clients to use the [`GET`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/GET) method instead.

**Note:** Some Web applications may use the `308 Permanent Redirect` in a non-standard way and for different purposes. For example, Google Drive uses a `308 Resume Incomplete` response to indicate to the client when an unfinished upload has stalled. See [Perform a resumable download](https://developers.google.com/workspace/drive/api/guides/manage-uploads) on the Google Drive documentation for more information.
