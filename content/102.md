## Description

**Deprecated:** This feature is no longer recommended. Though some browsers might still support it, it may have already been removed from the relevant web standards, may be in the process of being dropped, or may only be kept for compatibility purposes. Avoid using it, and update existing code if possible; see the [compatibility table](#browser_compatibility) at the bottom of this page to guide your decision. Be aware that this feature may cease to work at any time.

The HTTP **`102 Processing`** [informational response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#informational_responses) status code indicates to client that a full request has been received and the server is working on it. This status code is only sent if the server expects the request to take significant time.

**Note:** Regular web servers do not return this response. This status code was first introduced in Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning ([WebDAV](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/WebDAV)) [RFC 2518](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2518), but it was removed from WebDAV in [RFC 4918](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4918).
