## Description

The HTTP **`407 Proxy Authentication Required`** [client error response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#client_error_responses) status code indicates that the request did not succeed because it lacks valid authentication credentials for the [proxy server](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Proxy_server) that sits between the client and the server with access to the requested resource.

This response is sent with a [`Proxy-Authenticate`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Proxy-Authenticate) header that contains information on how to correctly authenticate requests. The client may repeat the request with a new or replaced [`Proxy-Authorization`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Proxy-Authorization) header field.

### Examples

A GET request is made to `example.com/admin`:

http

    GET /admin HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    

Along the way, an intermediary lets the client know that clients must be authenticated and provides information about the authentication scheme:

http

    HTTP/1.1 407 Proxy Authentication Required
    Date: Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT
    Proxy-Authenticate: Basic realm="Access to internal site"
