## Description

The HTTP **`410 Gone`** [client error response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#client_error_responses) status code indicates that the target resource is no longer available at the origin server and that this condition is likely to be permanent. A 410 response is cacheable by default.

Clients should not repeat requests for resources that return a 410 response, and website owners should remove or replace links that return this code. If server owners don't know whether this condition is temporary or permanent, a [`404`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/404) status code should be used instead.

### Examples

The following `GET` request is for a page with promotional content that is no longer valid:

http

    GET /promotions/summer-2023 HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    

http

    HTTP/1.1 410 Gone
    Content-Type: text/html
    Content-Length: 212
    
    <html lang="en-US">
      <head>
        <title>Promotion expired</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>Promotion expired</h1>
        <p>Promotion no longer active! See <a href="/offers">current offers</a>.</p>
      </body>
    </html>
