## Description

The HTTP **`412 Precondition Failed`** [client error response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#client_error_responses) status code indicates that access to the target resource was denied. This happens with [conditional requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Conditional_requests) on methods other than [`GET`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/GET) or [`HEAD`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/HEAD) when the condition defined by the [`If-Unmodified-Since`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/If-Unmodified-Since) or [`If-Match`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/If-Match) headers is not fulfilled. In that case, the request (usually an upload or a modification of a resource) cannot be made and this error response is sent back.

### Examples

http

    ETag: "33a64df551425fcc55e4d42a148795d9f25f89d4"
    ETag: W/"0815"
    

With the help of the `ETag` and the [`If-Match`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/If-Match) headers, you can prevent conflicts or mid-air collisions. For example, when editing some wiki pages, content is hashed and put into an `ETag` in successful responses:

http

    ETag: "33a64df551425fcc55e4d42a148795d9f25f89d4"
    

When saving changes to a wiki page (posting data), the [`POST`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/POST) request will contain the [`If-Match`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/If-Match) header containing the `ETag` values that the client stored from the last edit to check freshness of the resource on the server:

http

    If-Match: "33a64df551425fcc55e4d42a148795d9f25f89d4"
    

If the hashes don't match, the document has been edited in-between and a `412 Precondition Failed` error is thrown.
