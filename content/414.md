## Description

The HTTP **`414 URI Too Long`** [client error response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#client_error_responses) status code indicates that a URI requested by the client was longer than the server is willing to interpret.

There are a few rare conditions when this error might occur:

* a client has improperly converted a [`POST`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/POST) request to a [`GET`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/GET) request with long query information,
* a client has descended into a loop of redirection (for example, a redirected URI prefix that points to a suffix of itself), or
* the server is under attack by a client attempting to exploit potential security holes.

Some systems implement `414 URI Too Long` as `414 Request-URI Too Large`.

### Examples

In the following example, an HTML [`<form>` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/form#method) accidentally uses `get` instead of `post`. A large amount of form data is appended to the URL specified at the form's `action` attribute and is sent as a GET request:

http

    GET /search?feedback=it+was+the+best+of+times+it+was+the+worst+of+times… HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    

The particular server's URI length limit is reached with this request and a 414 is sent in response:

http

    HTTP/1.1 414 URI Too Long
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
    Date: Fri, 28 Jun 2024 11:40:58 GMT

    <!doctype html>

      <body>
        <h1>414 - URI Too Long</h1>
        <p>The URI provided was too long for the server to process.</p>
      </body>
    </html>
