## Description

The HTTP **`201 Created`** [successful response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#successful_responses) status code indicates that the HTTP request has led to the creation of a resource. This status code is commonly sent as the result of a [`POST`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/POST) request.

The new resource, or a description and link to the new resource, is created before the response is returned. The newly-created items can be returned in the body of the response message, but must be locatable by the **URL of the initiating request** or by the URL in the value of the [`Location`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Location) header provided with the response.

### Examples

Let's assume there's a REST API for managing users with an endpoint at `http://example.com/users`. In this example, we send a `POST` request with the following body to create a user:

http

    POST /users HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Content-Type: application/json
    
    {
      "firstName": "Brian",
      "lastName": "Smith",
      "email": "brian.smith@example.com"
    }
    

After successful user creation, the `201 Created` response will look like this:

http

    HTTP/1.1 201 Created
    Content-Type: application/json
    Location: http://example.com/users/123
    
    {
      "message": "New user created",
      "user": {
        "id": 123,
        "firstName": "Brian",
        "lastName": "Smith",
        "email": "brian.smith@example.com"
      }
    }
