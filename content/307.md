HTTP 307 Temporary Redirect redirect
status response code indicates that the resource requested has been temporarily moved to
the URL given by the Location headers.

The method and the body of the original request are reused to perform the redirected
request. In the cases where you want the method used to be changed to
GET, use 303 See Other instead. This is
useful when you want to give an answer to a PUT method that is not the
uploaded resources, but a confirmation message (like "You successfully uploaded XYZ").

The only difference between 307 and 302 is that
307 guarantees that the method and the body will not be changed when the
redirected request is made. With 302, some old clients were incorrectly
changing the method to GET: the behavior with non-GET
methods and 302 is then unpredictable on the Web, whereas the behavior with
307 is predictable. For GET requests, their behavior is
identical.
