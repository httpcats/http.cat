## Description

The HTTP **`307 Temporary Redirect`** [redirection response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#redirection_messages) status code indicates that the resource requested has been temporarily moved to the URL in the [`Location`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Location) header.

A browser receiving this status will automatically request the resource at the URL in the `Location` header, redirecting the user to the new page. Search engines receiving this response will not attribute links to the original URL to the new resource, meaning no [SEO](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/SEO) value is transferred to the new URL.

The method and the body of the original request are reused to perform the redirected request. In the cases where you want the request method to be changed to [`GET`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/GET), use [`303 See Other`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/303) instead. This is useful when you want to give an answer to a successful [`PUT`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/PUT) request that is not the uploaded resource, but a status monitor or confirmation message like "You have successfully uploaded XYZ".

The difference between `307` and [`302`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/302) is that `307` guarantees that the client **will not change** the request method and body when the redirected request is made. With `302`, older clients incorrectly changed the method to [`GET`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/GET). `307` and `302` responses are identical when the request method is [`GET`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/GET).

### Examples

The following [`GET`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/GET) request to is made to a resource that has a `307` redirection in place. The [`Location`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Location) header provides the URL of the redirected resource.
