The HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) 405 Method Not Allowed response status code indicates that the server knows the request method, but the target resource doesn't support this method.

The server must generate an Allow header field in a 405 status code response. The field must contain a list of methods that the target resource currently supports.
