## Description

The HTTP **`405 Method Not Allowed`** [client error response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#client_error_responses) status code indicates that the server knows the request method, but the target resource doesn't support this method. The server **must** generate an [`Allow`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Allow) header in a 405 response with a list of methods that the target resource currently supports.

Improper server-side permissions set on files or directories may cause a 405 response when the request would otherwise be expected to succeed.

### Examples

Server owners often disallow the use of the `TRACE` method due to security concerns. The following example shows a typical response where a server doesn't allow the use of `TRACE`:

http

    TRACE / HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    

http

    HTTP/1.1 405 Method Not Allowed
    Content-Length: 0
    Date: Fri, 28 Jun 2024 14:30:31 GMT
    Server: ECLF (nyd/D179)
    Allow: GET, POST, HEAD
