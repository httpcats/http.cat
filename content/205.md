## Description

The HTTP **`205 Reset Content`** [successful response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#successful_responses) status code indicates that the request has been successfully processed and the client should reset the document view.

This response is intended to support use cases where the user receives content that supports data entry, submits user-edited data in a request, and the content needs to be reset for the next entry. The instruction to "reset content" can mean clearing the contents of a form, resetting a canvas state, or refreshing a UI; the implementation depends on the client.

**Note:** In web applications that use the `205` status, it's assumed that the client handles resetting content after a `205` response. This is typically done via JavaScript, as resetting content such as forms after a `205` response is not handled natively by browsers.

Note that the response must not include any content or the [`Content-Length`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Length) header (browsers may reject responses that include content). The empty response may also be indicated using the [`Transfer-Encoding: chunked`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Transfer-Encoding) header with an empty chunk.

### Examples

The client in this example sends a `POST` request to submit a form with the comment `Hello!`:

http

    POST /submit HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    Content-Length: 15
    
    comment=Hello!
    

After successfully processing the form submission, the server responds with the following `205` response, indicating that the client should reset the form.

http

    HTTP/1.1 205 Reset Content
    Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
    Content-Length: 0
    Date: Wed, 26 Jun 2024 12:00:00 GMT
