## Description

<aside class="warning"><strong>Unofficial:</strong> This HTTP status code is not specified by any RFC.</aside>

The HTTP response status code `525 SSL Handshake Failed` is an unofficial HTTP status code specific to [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com).

The `525` error indicates that the SSL handshake between Cloudflare and the origin web server failed. Error `525` occurs when these two conditions are true:

- The SSL handshake fails between Cloudflare and the origin web server, and
- Full or Full (Strict) SSL is set in the Overview tab of your Cloudflare SSL/TLS app.

<aside class="info"><strong>Note:</strong> If your hosting provider frequently changes your origin web server’s IP address, refer to Cloudflare’s documentation on dynamic DNS updates.</aside>
