## Description

The HTTP **`226 IM Used`** [successful response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#successful_responses) status code indicates that the server is returning a [delta](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Delta) in response to a [`GET`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/GET) request. It is used in the context of _HTTP delta encodings_.

IM stands for _instance manipulation_, which refers to the algorithm generating a _delta_. In delta encoding, a client sends a [`GET`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/GET) request with two headers: `A-IM:`, which indicates a preference for a differencing algorithm, and [`If-None-Match`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/If-None-Match), which specifies the version of a resource it has. The server responds with deltas relative to a given base document, rather than the document in full. This response uses the `226` status code, an `IM:` header that describes the differencing algorithm used, and may include a `Delta-Base:` header with the [`ETag`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/ETag) matching the base document associated to the delta.

**Warning:** Poor support for HTTP delta encodings means there are few implementations. Instead, most systems rely solely on [compression methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Compression) to reduce bandwidth, although a combination of compression and delta encodings is possible.

Even if the client and server support delta encodings, proxies or caches may not, and the complexity of adding HTTP delta encodings to a system may outweigh the benefits.

### Examples

In the following `GET` request, a client requests a resource and has a cached version with the ETag `abcd123`. The `A-IM:` header indicates a preference for `vcdiff` and `diffe` delta algorithms:

http

    GET /resource.txt HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    A-IM: vcdiff, diffe
    If-None-Match: "abcd123"
    

Assuming the server supports delta encodings, it responds with the diff since the version with the ETag `abcd123`. The `IM` header indicates that the `vcdiff` algorithm is used, and the `Delta-Base:` header indicates that the diff is based on a resource with ETag `abcd123`.

http

    HTTP/1.1 226 IM Used
    ETag: "5678a23"
    IM: vcdiff
    Content-Type: text/plain
    Content-Length: 123
    Delta-Base: abcd123
    
    ...
