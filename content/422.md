## Description

The HTTP **`422 Unprocessable Content`** [client error response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#client_error_responses) status code indicates that the server understood the content type of the request content, and the syntax of the request content was correct, but it was unable to process the contained instructions.

Clients that receive a `422` response should expect that repeating the request without modification will fail with the same error.

### Examples

The following example makes a request to update file contents ([based on GitHub's API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/repos/contents?apiVersion=2022-11-28#create-or-update-file-contents)). The `content` field is [Base64](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Base64) encoded and uses `\n` line feeds every 60 characters, with one terminating the string:

http

    PUT /repos/mdn/content/contents/README.md HTTP/1.1
    Host: api.example.com
    Accept: application/vnd.github+json
    Authorization: Bearer abcd123
    Content-Type: application/json
    Content-Length: 165
    
    {
      "message": "My commit",
      "content": "WW9zaGkgd2FzIHRoZXJlLCBzbyB3ZXJlIEF5c2UsIGFuZCBCZWxnaW4uIEl0\nIHdhcyBncmVhdCE=\n",
      "sha": "80e73970fdee49dbdbac27c1f565d1eb1975d519"
    }
    

In this implementation, the server expects strictly [RFC 4648](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648)\-compliant Base64 encoded content (using [strict encoding methods](https://ruby-doc.org/3.3.2/stdlibs/base64/Base64.html#method-i-strict_encode64)). A `422` Unprocessable Content response is returned and the `message` field provides context about the validation error:

http

    HTTP/1.1 422 Unprocessable Content
    Date: Fri, 28 Jun 2024 12:00:00 GMT
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    Content-Length: 187
    
    {
      "message": "content is not valid Base64",
      "documentation_url": "https://docs.example.com/en/rest/repos/contents"
    }
