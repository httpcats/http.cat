## Description

The HTTP **`417 Expectation Failed`** [client error response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#client_error_responses) status code indicates that the expectation given in the request's [`Expect`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Expect) header could not be met. After receiving a 417 response, a client should repeat the request without an `Expect` request header, including the file in the request body without waiting for a [`100`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/100) response. See the [`Expect`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Expect) header documentation for more details.

### Examples

The following PUT request sends information about an intended file upload to a server. The client uses an `Expect: 100-continue` header and no request body to avoid sending data over the network that may result in an error such as [`405`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/405), [`401`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/401), or [`403`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/403) response:

http

    PUT /videos HTTP/1.1
    Host: uploads.example.com
    Content-Type: video/h264
    Content-Length: 1234567890987
    Expect: 100-continue
    

In this example server implementation, expectations are not supported and the presence of an `Expect` header with any value results in 417 responses:

http

    HTTP/1.1 417 Expectation Failed
    Date: Fri, 28 Jun 2024 11:40:58 GMT
    

The client responds by making a request without expectations and with the [content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP_Content) in the request body:

http

    PUT /videos HTTP/1.1
    Host: uploads.example.com
    Content-Type: video/h264
    Content-Length: 1234567890987
    
    […]
