## Description

The HTTP `100 Continue` informational status response code
indicates that everything so far is OK and that the client should continue with the
request or ignore it if it is already finished.


To have a server check the request's headers, a client must send
`Expect: 100-continue` as a header in its initial request
and receive a `100 Continue` status code in response before sending the body.
