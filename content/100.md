## Description

The HTTP **`100 Continue`** [informational response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#informational_responses) status code indicates that the initial part of a request has been received and has not yet been rejected by the server. The client should continue with a request or discard the 100 response if the request is already finished.

When a request has an [`Expect: 100-continue`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Expect) header, the 100 Continue response indicates that the server is ready or capable of receiving the request content. Waiting for a 100 Continue response can be helpful if a client anticipates that an error is likely, for example, when sending state-changing operations without previously verified authentication credentials.

### Examples

The following [`PUT`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/PUT) request sends information to a server about a file upload. The client is indicating that it will proceed with the content if it receives a 100 response to avoid sending data over the network that could result in an error like [`405`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/405), [`401`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/401), or [`403`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/403). At first, the client sends headers only, including an [`Expect: 100-continue`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Expect) header:

http

    PUT /videos HTTP/1.1
    Host: uploads.example.com
    Content-Type: video/h264
    Content-Length: 123456789
    Expect: 100-continue
    

The server indicates that the request can proceed:

http

    HTTP/1.1 100 Continue
    

The client completes the request by sending the actual data:

http

    [Video data as content for PUT request]
