## Description

The HTTP **`507 Insufficient Storage`** [server error response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#server_error_responses) status code indicates that an action could not be performed because the server does not have enough available storage to successfully complete the request.

This status code was first used in the context of Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning ([WebDAV](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/WebDAV)), but has propagated into other use cases to describe situations where server resources are exhausted. Common causes of this error can be from server directories running out of available space, not enough available RAM for an operation, or internal limits reached (such as application-specific memory limits, for example). The request causing this error does not necessarily need to include content, as it may be a request that would create a resource on the server if it was successful.

This issue is considered temporary, as opposed to a [`413 Content Too Large`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/413), which indicates that the client request is too large for the server to process regardless of server resource constraints.

### Examples

The following request attempts to upload a file to a server which has insufficient storage available. The server responds with a `507` to indicate that its resources are exhausted:

http

    POST /upload HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Content-Type: image/jpeg
    Content-Length: 123456
    
    [JPG file data]

    Content-Length: 230
