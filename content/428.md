## Description

The HTTP `428 Precondition Required` response status code indicates that the server requires the request to be conditional.

Typically, this means that a required precondition header, such as `If-Match`, is missing.

When a precondition header is not matching the server side state, the response should be `412 Precondition Failed`.
