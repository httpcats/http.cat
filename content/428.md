## Description

The HTTP **`428 Precondition Required`** [client error response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#client_error_responses) status code indicates that the server requires the request to be [conditional](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Conditional_requests).

Typically, a 428 response means that a required precondition header such as [`If-Match`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/If-Match) **is missing**. When a precondition header does **not match** the server-side state, the response should be [`412 Precondition Failed`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/412).

### Examples

A client has fetched a resource `my-document` from the server, updated it locally, and then tries to send the updated document back to the server:

http

    PUT /docs/my-document HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Content-Type: application/json
    
    {
      […]
    

The server implementation requires that all [`PUT`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/PUT) requests for the specific path or type of documents must be conditional and sends a 428 response:

http

    HTTP/1.1 428 Precondition Required
    Date: Wed, 26 Jun 2024 12:00:00 GMT
    Server: Apache/2.4.1 (Unix)
    Content-Type: application/json
    
    {
      "code": "MissingPrecondition",
      "message": "Updating documents requires a precondition header.",
    }
