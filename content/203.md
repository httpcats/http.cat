The HTTP 203 Non-Authoritative Information response
status indicates that the request was successful but the enclosed payload has been
modified by a transforming proxy from that of the origin
server's 200 (OK) response.


The 203 response is similar to the value
214,
meaning Transformation Applied, of the Warning header
code, which has the additional advantage of being applicable to responses with any
status code.
