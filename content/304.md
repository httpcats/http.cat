## Description

The HTTP **`304 Not Modified`** [redirection response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#redirection_messages) status code indicates that there is no need to retransmit the requested resources.

This response code is sent when the request is a [conditional](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Conditional_requests) [`GET`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/GET) or [`HEAD`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/HEAD) request with an [`If-None-Match`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/If-None-Match) or an [`If-Modified-Since`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/If-Modified-Since) header and the condition evaluates to 'false'. It confirms that the resource cached by the client is still valid and that the server would have sent a [`200 OK`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/200) response with the resource if the condition evaluated to 'true'. See [HTTP caching](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Guides/Caching) for more information.

The response must not contain a body and must include the headers that would have been sent in an equivalent [`200`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/200) response, such as:

* [`Cache-Control`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Cache-Control)
* [`Content-Location`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Location)
* [`Date`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Date)
* [`ETag`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/ETag)
* [`Expires`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Expires)
* [`Vary`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Vary)

**Note:** Many [developer tools' network panels](https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/network_monitor/index.html) of browsers create extraneous requests leading to `304` responses, so that access to the local cache is visible to developers.

### Examples

The examples below show [`GET`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Methods/GET) requests made using [curl](https://curl.se/) with conditional request headers. The `--http1.1` flag is used to force the HTTP/1.1 protocol for readability.

The first request uses an `If-Modified-Since` condition with a future date of 21st November 2050. This must evaluate to `false`, because the resource can't have been updated after a time that hasn't happened yet:

bash

    curl --http1.1 -I --header 'If-Modified-Since: Tue, 21 Nov 2050 08:00:00 GMT' \
     https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/
    

This will result in the following HTTP request:

http

    GET /en-US/ HTTP/1.1
    Host: developer.mozilla.org
    User-Agent: curl/8.7.1
    Accept: */*
    If-Modified-Since: Tue, 21 Nov 2050 08:00:00 GMT
    

The response would be [`200 OK`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/200) with the current version of the resource if the resource had been updated after the timestamp in the [`If-Modified-Since`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/If-Modified-Since) header. Instead, we get a `304` response that includes [`ETag`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/ETag), [`Age`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Age) and [`Expires`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Expires) headers, telling us our cached version of the resource is still current:

http

    HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
    Date: Wed, 28 Aug 2024 09:52:35 GMT
    Expires: Wed, 28 Aug 2024 10:01:53 GMT
    Age: 3279
    ETag: "b20a0973b226eeea30362acb81f9e0b3"
    Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600
    Vary: Accept-Encoding
    X-cache: hit
    Alt-Svc: clear
    

Now run another `curl` command using the `etag` value from the previous response with the [`If-None-Match`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/If-None-Match) condition (since this `etag` is the current version of the resource on the server we expect to receive a `304 Not Modified` response):

bash

    curl --http1.1 -I --header 'If-None-Match: "b20a0973b226eeea30362acb81f9e0b3"' \
     https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/
    

This will result in the following HTTP request:

http

    GET /en-US/ HTTP/1.1
    Host: developer.mozilla.org
    User-Agent: curl/8.7.1
    Accept: */*
    If-None-Match: "b20a0973b226eeea30362acb81f9e0b3"
    

Because the `etag` value matches at the time of the request, the entity tag fails the condition, and a `304` response is returned:

http

    HTTP/1.1 304 Not Modified
    Date: Wed, 28 Aug 2024 10:36:35 GMT
    Expires: Wed, 28 Aug 2024 11:02:17 GMT
    Age: 662
    ETag: "b20a0973b226eeea30362acb81f9e0b3"
    Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600
    Vary: Accept-Encoding
    X-cache: hit
    Alt-Svc: clear

### Compatibility notes

Browser behavior differs if this response erroneously includes a body on persistent connections. See [`204 No Content`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/204) for more details.
