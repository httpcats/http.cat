## Description

The HTTP **`400 Bad Request`** [client error response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#client_error_responses) status code indicates that the server would not process the request due to something the server considered to be a client error. The reason for a `400` response is typically due to malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing.

Clients that receive a `400` response should expect that repeating the request without modification will fail with the same error.

### Examples

Assuming a [REST](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/REST) API exists with an endpoint to manage users at `http://example.com/users` and a `POST` request with the following body attempts to create a user, but uses invalid JSON with unescaped line breaks:

http

    POST /users HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Content-Type: application/json
    Content-Length: 38
    
    {
      "email": "b@example.com
    ",
      "username": "b.smith"
    }
    

If the [content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP_Content) is in a valid format, we would expect a [`201 Created`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status/201) response or another success message, but instead the server responds with a `400` and the response body includes a `message` field with some context so the client can retry the action with a properly-formed request:

http

    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    Content-Type: application/json
    Content-Length: 71
    
    {
      "error": "Bad request",
      "message": "Request body could not be read properly.",
    }
