## Description

The HTTP **`415 Unsupported Media Type`** [client error response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#client_error_responses) status code indicates that the server refused to accept the request because the message [content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP_Content) format is not supported.

The format problem might be due to the request's indicated [`Content-Type`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Type) or [`Content-Encoding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Encoding), or as a result of processing the request message content. Some servers may be strict about the expected `Content-Type` of requests. For example, sending `UTF8` instead of `UTF-8` to specify the [UTF-8](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/UTF-8) charset may cause the server to consider the media type invalid.

### Examples

In the following example, the [`Content-Type`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Type) header is missing entirely:

http

    POST /comments HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Content-Length: 23
    
    {
      "user": "belgin",
      "comment": "LGTM!"
    }
    

If the server implementation expects at least a MIME type `Content-Type: application/json;` for the request at that endpoint, it may send the following response:

http

    HTTP/1.1 415 Unsupported Media Type
    Date: Fri, 28 Jun 2024 12:00:00 GMT
    Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
    Accept-Post: application/json; charset=UTF-8
    Content-Length: 0
    

In the following example, the [`Content-Type`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Content-Type) header is incorrectly set to URL-encoded form data when the [content](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/HTTP_Content) is in the request body instead:

http

    POST /comments HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    Content-Length: 23
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
    
    {
      "user": "belgin",
      "comment": "LGTM!"
    }
    

In this case, the server responds with a 415, with the required content type for the request in the [`Accept-Post`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers/Accept-Post) header:

http

    HTTP/1.1 415 Unsupported Media Type
    Date: Fri, 28 Jun 2024 12:00:00 GMT
    Server: Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
    Accept-Post: application/json; charset=UTF-8
    Content-Length: 0
