## Description

The HTTP **`421 Misdirected Request`** [client error response](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Status#client_error_responses) status code indicates that the request was directed to a server that is not able to produce a response. This can be sent by a server that is not configured to produce responses for the combination of [scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Reference/Schemes) and [authority](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/URI/Reference/Authority) that are included in the request URI.

Clients may retry the request over a different connection.

### Examples

Given the following request:

http

    GET / HTTP/1.1
    Host: abc.example.com
    

In cases such as a wildcard certificate (`*.example.com`) where a connection is reused for multiple domains (`abc.example.com`, `def.example.com`), the server may respond with a 421:

http

    HTTP/1.1 421 Misdirected Request
    Date: Wed, 26 Jun 2024 12:00:00 GMT
    Server: Apache/2.4.1 (Unix)
